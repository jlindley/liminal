These plans should generally be executed using skills like executing-plans or executing-spikes.

The status of a plan should always be clear, include an initial status line:

Status: <draft|ready|underway|implemented|cancelled|outdated>

Draft -- this plan is a work in progress and should not be implemented yet
Ready -- agent & human partner have agreed this is ready to be implemented
Underway -- work is partially complete and being worked on actively
Implemented -- this plan has been carried out
Cancelled -- this plan is dropped and this document makes for a poor reference on the project, be cautious
Outdated -- this plan was implemented but has been superceded sufficiently by other work that this plan may not be a good reference for the project
